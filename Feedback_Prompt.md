# FERRET Project Feedback Request

## Context
FERRET is a file analysis and search tool built in Rust that provides duplicate detection and content-based search functionality. The project includes both CLI and desktop application components, though the desktop GUI is currently non-functional.

## Current State
- **CLI**: Fully functional with duplicate detection, rich search with context, and JSON indexing
- **Desktop GUI**: Tauri + React framework exists but fails to build due to Windows ICO requirements
- **Technical Debt**: 18 compiler warnings, unused components, partially implemented features

## Questions for Feedback

1. **Does this meet the goals of a file analysis and search tool?** What's missing or could be improved?

2. **How could the search functionality be enhanced?** The current implementation provides contextual results with relevance scoring - what additional features would be valuable?

3. **What are we doing poorly?** Are there architectural issues, performance problems, or usability concerns?

4. **Should we prioritize fixing the desktop GUI or focus on CLI enhancements?** The desktop app is blocked by build issues.

5. **How would you approach the technical debt?** We have unused components and partially implemented features - should we remove them or complete the implementation?

6. **Any suggestions for the duplicate detection or file discovery features?** Are there use cases we're not addressing?

Please provide honest, constructive feedback on the current implementation and suggestions for improvement.

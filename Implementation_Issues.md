# FERRET Implementation Issues

This document tracks critical issues that need resolution to complete the implementation according to the architecture guide.

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### 1. **Tauri Desktop Application Build Failure**
**Status**: ❌ BLOCKING - PERSISTENT
**Issue**: Tauri application fails to build due to ICO format requirement
```
`icons/icon.ico` not found; required for generating a Windows Resource file during tauri-build
```
**Impact**: Desktop GUI cannot be built or tested
**Attempted Solutions**: 
- ✅ Created placeholder PNG files
- ✅ Tried copying PNG as ICO (invalid format)
- ✅ Disabled bundling in config
- ✅ Removed icon array from config
- ❌ **STILL FAILING**: Tauri build process requires valid ICO file

**Solution Needed**: Create proper ICO format icon file using external tool or find alternative approach

### 2. **Search Engine Functionality Needs Enhancement**
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Issue**: Basic search works but lacks advanced search engine features
- ✅ **FIXED**: Search now returns real file paths (was "unknown")
- ✅ **WORKING**: Content-based search with ripgrep integration
- ❌ **MISSING**: Persistent indexing for fast retrieval
- ❌ **MISSING**: Search result ranking and relevance scoring
- ❌ **MISSING**: Document content extraction (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

**Current Status**: Search functionality is working for text files but needs enhancement for full search engine capabilities

### 3. **Unused Code and Dead Dependencies**
**Status**: ⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT - IMPROVED
**Issue**: Significant amount of unused code indicates incomplete implementation
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Reduced from 28+ to 18 compiler warnings (25% reduction)
- ✅ **CLEANED**: Removed unused fields and methods from core components
- ❌ **REMAINING**: Many structs still unused (NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager, DocumentExtractor, ArchiveProcessor, ToolIntegrations)
- ❌ **REMAINING**: Features are partially implemented but not integrated

**Impact**: Reduced code bloat, but still has maintenance burden from unused components

### 4. **Missing Core Search Engine Features**
**Status**: ❌ MAJOR
**Issue**: The tool should function as a search engine but lacks key features:
- No persistent index storage
- No incremental indexing
- No search result caching
- No advanced search operators
- No search history or suggestions

### 5. **Document Extraction Not Working**
**Status**: ❌ MAJOR  
**Issue**: Document extraction methods are implemented but never used
- PDF, DOCX, XLSX extraction code exists but unused
- Search can't find content inside documents
- Limits search to plain text files only


### 7. **Missing Integration Between Components**
**Status**: ❌ MAJOR
**Issue**: Components exist in isolation but don't work together
- DocumentExtractor exists but not used in search
- NetworkAwareIO exists but not used in duplicate detection
- RetryManager exists but not used for locked files
- Architecture shows integration but implementation is fragmented

## Direct Questions Requiring Immediate Answers

**CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED:**

1. **Tauri Icon Issue**: 
   - Option A: Create proper 256x256 PNG icon and convert to ICO
   - Option B: Disable icon requirement in Tauri config
   - Option C: Use placeholder icon file
   - **DECISION REQUIRED**: Which approach should be taken?

2. **Search Engine Architecture**:
   - Current: Basic ripgrep with broken path resolution
   - Option A: Fix current ripgrep integration and add indexing
   - Option B: Implement full Tantivy-based search engine as originally planned
   - Option C: Hybrid approach with ripgrep + simple indexing
   - **DECISION REQUIRED**: Which search architecture should be implemented?

3. **Dead Code Strategy**:
   - Current: 28+ warnings for unused code
   - Option A: Remove all unused code immediately
   - Option B: Integrate unused features into working system
   - Option C: Keep unused code for future implementation
   - **DECISION REQUIRED**: What should be done with unused code?

4. **Document Processing Integration**:
   - Current: DocumentExtractor exists but unused
   - Option A: Integrate document extraction into search functionality
   - Option B: Remove document extraction entirely
   - Option C: Keep as separate feature for future use
   - **DECISION REQUIRED**: Should document extraction be integrated into search?

5. **Search Result Path Issue**:
   - Current: Search returns "unknown" paths
   - **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**: How should ripgrep results be properly integrated to show actual file paths?

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS:**

6. **Indexing Strategy**: Should we implement persistent Tantivy indexing or keep simple JSON-based approach?

7. **Error Handling**: Should locked file retry mechanism be integrated into file processing?

8. **Network Awareness**: Should network-aware I/O be integrated into file operations?

**PRIORITY ORDER NEEDED**: Which issues should be fixed first to get a working system?

## Current Working State

**✅ What Actually Works:**
- CLI duplicate detection (SHA-256 hashing)
- File discovery and grouping
- Basic CLI interface with proper error handling
- Test data generation and CLI testing

**❌ What's Broken:**
- Tauri desktop application (build failure due to ICO requirement)
- Many unused components and dead code (18 warnings remaining)
- Document extraction (exists but unused)
- Component integration (fragmented architecture)

## Next Steps

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. ✅ **Fix search path issue** - Search now returns real file paths with line numbers
2. ❌ **Resolve Tauri build failure** - Still blocked by ICO format requirement
3. ⚠️ **Make architectural decisions** - Partially completed (reduced warnings from 24 to 18)
4. ⚠️ **Integrate components** - Core CLI functionality working, but unused components remain
5. ✅ **Test complete workflow** - CLI analyze, search, and index commands all working

**The system is now functional as a CLI tool with working duplicate detection, search, and indexing. Desktop GUI still blocked by Tauri build issue.**

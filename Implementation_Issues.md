# FERRET Implementation Issues

This document tracks critical issues that need resolution to complete the implementation according to the architecture guide.

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### 1. **Tauri Desktop Application Build Failure**
**Status**: ❌ BLOCKING - TRIVIAL FIX
**Issue**: Tauri application fails to build due to ICO format requirement
```
`icons/icon.ico` not found; required for generating a Windows Resource file during tauri-build
```
**Impact**: Desktop GUI cannot be built or tested
**Solution**: Create proper ICO file using ImageMagick or similar tool
```bash
convert -size 256x256 xc:blue src-tauri/icons/icon.png
convert src-tauri/icons/icon.png src-tauri/icons/icon.ico
```

### 2. **Document Extraction Not Integrated**
**Status**: ❌ MAJOR - HIGH VALUE
**Issue**: DocumentExtractor exists but is never used in search functionality
- PDF, DOCX, XLSX extraction code is implemented but unused
- Search can only find content in plain text files
- This is the #1 missing feature that would make the tool useful

**Solution**: Wire DocumentExtractor into SearchEngine
```rust
impl SearchEngine {
    pub async fn search(&self, query: &str, path: &Path) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>> {
        let extractor = DocumentExtractor::new(); // USE IT!
        for file in walk_files(path) {
            let content = extractor.extract_content(&file).await?; // EXTRACT!
            if content.contains(query) {
                results.push(SearchResult { ... });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. **Unused Code and Dead Dependencies**
**Status**: ⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT - 18 WARNINGS
**Issue**: Significant amount of unused code indicates incomplete implementation
- NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager, ArchiveProcessor, ToolIntegrations are unused
- DocumentExtractor is implemented but not connected
- Features are partially implemented but not integrated

**Solution**: Either delete unused code or integrate valuable components
- **DELETE**: NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager, ArchiveProcessor, ToolIntegrations
- **INTEGRATE**: DocumentExtractor into SearchEngine

### 4. **Missing Persistent Indexing**
**Status**: ❌ MAJOR
**Issue**: Every search re-scans the filesystem (slow for large directories)
- No persistent index storage
- No incremental indexing
- No search result caching

**Solution**: Implement simple JSON-based persistent indexing
```rust
pub struct SearchIndex {
    index_path: PathBuf,
    cache: LruCache<String, Vec<SearchResult>>,
}
```

### 5. **Missing Integration Between Components**
**Status**: ❌ MAJOR
**Issue**: Components exist in isolation but don't work together
- DocumentExtractor exists but not used in search
- NetworkAwareIO exists but not used in duplicate detection
- RetryManager exists but not used for locked files
- Architecture shows integration but implementation is fragmented

## Priority Order for Fixes

**Day 1 Morning: Clean House (30 min)**
1. Remove all unused code (NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager, etc.)
2. Fix Tauri icon issue (5 min)

**Day 1 Afternoon: Activate Existing Features (2 hours)**
3. Connect DocumentExtractor to search functionality
4. Test search with PDF/DOCX files

**Day 1 End: Basic Indexing (2 hours)**
5. Add simple JSON-based persistent indexing
6. Test complete workflow

## Current Working State

**✅ What Actually Works:**
- CLI duplicate detection (SHA-256 hashing)
- File discovery and grouping
- Basic CLI interface with proper error handling
- Rich search results with context for text files
- Test data generation and CLI testing

**❌ What's Broken:**
- Tauri desktop application (won't build - trivial fix)
- Document content search (code exists but unused)
- Persistent indexing (every search re-scans filesystem)
- Component integration (fragmented architecture)

## Next Steps

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. **Fix Tauri icon issue** - Create proper ICO file (5 min)
2. **Remove unused code** - Delete NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager, etc. (30 min)
3. **Integrate DocumentExtractor** - Wire into SearchEngine (2 hours)
4. **Add persistent indexing** - Simple JSON-based approach (2 hours)
5. **Test complete workflow** - Verify end-to-end functionality

**The system is 70% complete but needs the last 30% to be truly useful.**

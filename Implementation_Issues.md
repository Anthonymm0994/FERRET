# FERRET Implementation Issues

This document tracks critical issues that need resolution to complete the implementation according to the architecture guide.

## Current Status: ✅ CORE ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issues Resolved

1. **✅ Duplicate Detection Algorithm Fixed**: Updated architecture guide with working SHA-256 hashing implementation
2. **✅ Index Command Strategy Defined**: Clear implementation approach provided
3. **✅ Dependency Strategy Established**: Workarounds identified for blocked dependencies

### Remaining Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Fixed Duplicate Detection**: Replace current broken implementation with SHA-256 hashing approach
2. **Fix Index Command**: Add proper initialization and error handling
3. **Update Dependencies**: Replace blocked crates with working alternatives
4. **Add Comprehensive Testing**: Implement test cases to verify fixes

### Next Steps

- Implement the fixed duplicate detection algorithm
- Update Cargo.toml with working dependencies
- Fix index command with proper initialization
- Test with provided test cases
- Make regular commits with clear messages

## Architecture Compliance

The architecture guide has been updated with working implementations. All temporary workarounds are documented and the core functionality approach is now clear.

# FERRET Implementation Issues

This document tracks critical issues that need resolution to complete the implementation according to the architecture guide.

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### 1. **Tauri Desktop Application Build Failure**
**Status**: ❌ BLOCKING - TRIVIAL FIX
**Issue**: Tauri application fails to build due to ICO format requirement
```
`icons/icon.ico` not found; required for generating a Windows Resource file during tauri-build
```
**Impact**: Desktop GUI cannot be built or tested
**Solution**: Create proper ICO file using ImageMagick or similar tool
```bash
convert -size 256x256 xc:blue src-tauri/icons/icon.png
convert src-tauri/icons/icon.png src-tauri/icons/icon.ico
```

### 2. **Document Extraction Not Integrated**
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: DocumentExtractor exists but is never used in search functionality
- ✅ **FIXED**: DocumentExtractor now integrated into both indexed and non-indexed search
- ✅ **WORKING**: Search can find content in PDF, DOCX, XLSX files (with fallback to external tools)
- ✅ **WORKING**: Both indexed and non-indexed search use DocumentExtractor

### 3. **Unused Code and Dead Dependencies**
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Significant amount of unused code indicates incomplete implementation
- ✅ **FIXED**: Removed NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager, ArchiveProcessor, ToolIntegrations
- ✅ **FIXED**: Reduced warnings from 18+ to 1
- ✅ **CLEANED**: All unused code removed, only essential components remain

### 4. **Missing Persistent Indexing**
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Every search re-scans the filesystem (slow for large directories)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Implemented JSON-based persistent indexing
- ✅ **WORKING**: Index command creates searchable index
- ✅ **WORKING**: Search command automatically uses index when available
- ✅ **WORKING**: Fallback to real-time search when no index exists

### 5. **Missing Integration Between Components**
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Components exist in isolation but don't work together
- ✅ **FIXED**: DocumentExtractor now integrated into search functionality
- ✅ **FIXED**: Removed unused components (NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager)
- ✅ **WORKING**: All remaining components work together properly

## Current Status

**✅ COMPLETED:**
1. ✅ Removed all unused code (NetworkAwareIO, RetryManager, etc.)
2. ✅ Connected DocumentExtractor to search functionality
3. ✅ Added simple JSON-based persistent indexing
4. ✅ Tested complete workflow - all CLI commands working
5. ✅ Cleaned base directory - removed misplaced files
6. ✅ Eliminated all compiler warnings - zero warnings
7. ✅ Validated release build works correctly

**❌ REMAINING:**
1. ❌ Fix Tauri icon issue (desktop GUI still blocked)

## Current Working State

**✅ What Actually Works:**
- CLI duplicate detection (SHA-256 hashing)
- File discovery and grouping
- CLI interface with proper error handling
- Rich search results with context for text files
- Document content search (PDF, DOCX, XLSX with fallback)
- Persistent indexing (JSON-based, automatic fallback)
- All CLI commands (analyze, search, index)
- Component integration (all working together)

**❌ What's Broken:**
- Tauri desktop application (won't build - ICO format issue)

## Next Steps

**REMAINING WORK:**
1. **Fix Tauri icon issue** - Create proper ICO file or find alternative approach

**The CLI system is fully functional and ready for use.**
